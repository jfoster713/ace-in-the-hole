                <p>Try-A-Tri: This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the sport, our Junior Triathletes. The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).
                </p>

                <p>Half Marathon COURSE: Half-Marathon (13.1-miles): Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once finished, runners can enjoy the finish line festivities, including the Sports & Fitness Expo and live entertainment.

                </p>

                <p>10k COURSE: The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.
